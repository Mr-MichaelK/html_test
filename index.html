        <h2>This is an <strong>h2</strong> header, which is slightly smaller</h2>
        <p>This text, on the other hand, is a <strong>paragraph</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph. Beacuse it is <em>nested</em> at the same level as the
            paragraph above, we say these two paragraphs are <em>brothers</em>.
