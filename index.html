        <h1>This is an example of an <strong>h1</strong> header</h1>
        <h2>This is an <strong>h2</strong> header, which is slightly smaller</h2>
        <p>This text, on the other hand, is a <strong>paragraph</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph. Because it is <em>nested</em> at the same level as the
            paragraph above, we say these two paragraphs are <em>brothers</em>.
        </p>
        <p>To demonstrate my understanding of HTML unordered lists, I will be sharing 3 of my favorite
            things to shop:
        </p>
        <ul>
            Can i write here? <mark>Yes, yes I can</mark>
            <li>Bread: I'm a simple man. I secure the necessities before the desires.</li>
            <li>Chips: Everyone loves a bag of crunchy potato chips. Don't judge me.</li>
            <li>Chocolate: Will you ask about this too? Get a life!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But hey, that's not all I can do. I can tamper with ordered lists too. Check out my today's
            todo list:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <b>No, you cannot <i>stop</i> me from writing here. It's a <del>urge</del> habit now</b>
            <li>Finish the HTML section today</li>
            <li>Read till Psalms 90</li>
            <li>Put myself to sleep. It's an insomiacs <strong><em><ins><mark>nightmare</mark></ins></em></strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>What's the matter? Not convinced I can work with this? Fine. I'll show you more stuff.</p>
        <ul>
            I have a few places I want to visit sometime. I'll only tell you a few: <del>I don't trust
                you with this...</del>
            <li>Italy</li>
            <li>London</li>
            <li>Moscow</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stop whining you'll get your ordered lists too...</p>
        <ol>Top 5 video games by series: <del>Not an opinion btw. It's all facts</del>
            <li>Metal Gear Solid</li>
            <li>Splinter Cell</li>
            <li>God of War</li>
            <li>Metal Slug</li>
            <li>Doom (i don't play it though)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Done stalking? Good. The back button should be somewhere here. I wouldn't know where though.
            I'm not a quitter ;)
